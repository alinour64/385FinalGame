        <h2>Playtesting Reports</h2>
        <p>
<strong> Playtest 1: </strong> </br>
<strong> Issues Identified: </strong> Inconsistent movement feel and awkward key bind positions. </br>

        <h2>Team Reflection</h2>
        <p>
Reflecting on the development of Launcher Hijinx, we feel a strong sense of accomplishment and growth. From the initial brainstorming stages to the final implementation, each step was a learning process. We overcame challenges such as sharing our code, balancing the controlled yet unpredictable movement, creating an intuitive and convenient key binding system, and introducing an effective life mechanism. Our commitment to receiving and applying feedback was important to refining the game, and we saw firsthand how crucial playtesting is for uncovering and addressing potential issues.

One of the most enriching aspects of this project was how our team collaborated. Each member brought unique ideas and skills to the table, and this diverse input was critical in shaping Launcher Hijinx. While we are proud of our achievement, we also acknowledge that the process was just as important as the outcome. The experience taught us valuable lessons in planning, collaboration, resilience, and the art of game design. Looking forward, we are excited to apply these learnings to future projects, always striving to create engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences.
