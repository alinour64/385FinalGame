        <p>
            <strong>Ibrahim:</strong> <br />
            <strong> Week 1 (April 9):</strong> Considered multiple game ideas/genres/concepts I wanted to add to our
            game<br />
            <strong>Week 2 (April 16): </strong>Looked at and played multiple different games similar to our ideas for
            inspiration. Took notes of multiple things that made theses games “feel” professional<br />
            <strong>Week 3 (April 23):</strong> Created a basic script for movement and jumping, as well as springs for
            players to jump on<br />
            <strong>Week 4 (April 30):</strong> Further improved upon movement in order to add physics and make it feel
            like a professional game, implemented double jump<br />
            <strong>Week 5 (May 7):</strong> Administered testers to play our game to find out information about our
            game from a players standpoint (Bugs, Playstyle, Learning curve, etc)<br />
            <strong>Week 6 (May 14):</strong> Implemented platform functionality which includes dropping through and
            jump up platforms<br />
            <strong>Week 7 (May 21):</strong> Managed and created the level design of the game using Kirby’s sprites,
            tested to make sure increased scale didn’t break anything (it broke death hitboxes which we fixed)<br />
            <strong>Week 8 (May 28): </strong>Fixed multiple bugs related to collision and physics to make gameplay less
            glitchy<br />
        </p>

            the main gameplay.<br />
            <strong>Week 3: </strong>Implemented a simple implementation for a basic launcher, the Slingshot.<br />
            <strong>Week 4: </strong>Began to fine tune the bullet behavior and implemented the loadout system, allowing

        <h2>Playtesting Reports</h2>
        <p>
            <strong> Playtest 1: </strong> </br>
            <strong> Issues Identified: </strong> Inconsistent movement feel and awkward key bind positions. </br>
            <strong> Action Taken: </strong> Improved player movement dynamics for faster acceleration and deceleration.
            Reconfigured keybinds to align with natural hand positioning on the keyboard. </br>
            <strong> Playtest 2: </strong> </br>
            <strong> Issues Identified: </strong> Inconsiderate key bind positions for smaller keyboards, invisible but
            clickable menu buttons during gameplay, and absence of game instructions at the start. </br>
            <strong> Action Taken: </strong> Adjusted keybinds to accommodate 60% keyboards. Disabled the menu's hit box
            when it's not active. Integrated a start menu that displays the keybinds and provides initial game
            instructions.</br>
            <strong> Playtest 3: </strong> </br>
            <strong> Issues Identified: </strong> A bug causing camera glitches and instant player deaths when both
            characters perished simultaneously. </br>
            <strong> Action Taken: </strong> Implemented minimum and maximum bounds to the camera movement to prevent
            glitches. </br>

        <h2>Team Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Reflecting on the development of Launcher Hijinx, we feel a strong sense of accomplishment and growth. From
            the initial brainstorming stages to the final implementation, each step was a learning process. We overcame
            challenges such as sharing our code, balancing the controlled yet unpredictable movement, creating an
            intuitive and convenient key binding system, and introducing an effective life mechanism. Our commitment to
            receiving and applying feedback was important to refining the game, and we saw firsthand how crucial
            playtesting is for uncovering and addressing potential issues.

            One of the most enriching aspects of this project was how our team collaborated. Each member brought unique
            ideas and skills to the table, and this diverse input was critical in shaping Launcher Hijinx. While we are
            proud of our achievement, we also acknowledge that the process was just as important as the outcome. The
            experience taught us valuable lessons in planning, collaboration, resilience, and the art of game design.
            Looking forward, we are excited to apply these learnings to future projects, always striving to create
            engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences.
